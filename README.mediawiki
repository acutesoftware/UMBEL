== Introduction ==

UMBEL is the Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer, designed to help content interoperate on the Web.

UMBEL provides two valuable functions:

First, it is a broad, general reference structure of 28,000 concepts, which provides a scaffolding to link and interoperate other datasets and domain vocabularies, and Second, it is a base vocabulary for the construction of other concept-based domain ontologies, also designed for interoperation.

== Documentation ==

All the documentation related to umbel is available on [http://umbel.org UMBEL's main website].

From that website, you can easily search and browse the ontology. This portal is supported by a rich set of APIs and functionality written in Clojure.
